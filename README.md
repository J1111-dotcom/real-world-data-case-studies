# Real-World Data Case Studies

A curated collection of domain-specific data projects grounded in real-world scenarios.  
These case studies simulate the role of a data analyst or data scientist in industries such as real estate, automotive, finance, and more.

Each project begins with a practical business challenge, walks through data exploration and modeling, and ends with actionable insights or solutions. Whether it's pricing a used car, detecting fraud, or forecasting housing trends, this repository showcases how data science can drive value across domains.


## Case Studies by Domain

### Real Estate
- **[Residential Price Prediction](real_estate/real_estate_price_prediction_case)**  
  Predict house prices using square footage, number of rooms, and other features.

### Automotive
- **[Ford Car Resale Pricing Model](automotive)**  
  Build and tune regression models to optimize resale quotations for Ford vehicles.

### Finance
- **[Credit Card Fraud Detection](finance/credit-card-fraud-detection)**  
  Use classification techniques to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.


## About This Repository

Each folder includes:
- A self-contained Jupyter notebook
- Cleaned datasets stored locally in a `data/` directory
- Visualizations and insight summaries
- A project-specific README with business context

This repository complements my [mini-projects](https://github.com/J1111-dotcom/mini-projects) collection, which focuses on technical experimentation and smaller-scale, skill-driven projects such as automation scripts, data cleaning workflows, and quick machine learning prototypes.
